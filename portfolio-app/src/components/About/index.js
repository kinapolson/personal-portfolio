        <p className="about-section"> 
          Hi, my name is Kina Polson! 
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Digital Media with a minor in Computer Science
          at the University of Central FLorida, where I have built a strong foundation in design and development.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          With hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more, I enjoy
          bringing digital ideas to life through aesthetic, functional, and user-friendly
          web applications.
          <br></br> 
          <br></br>
          I have curated my skills through academic projects, leadership roles, and programs like the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion, 
          where I collaborated on multiple web projects. As a former Residential Mentor for UCF Inclusive Education Services, 
          I developed excellent communication, time management, and problem-solving skills that I now carry into my work.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          I am a quick learner who thrives in creative, collaborative environments—and I’m excited to continue growing as
          a web developer.
